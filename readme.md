## Description:
> This is a personal project that showcases CRUD (create-reade-update-delete)
by enabling the user to create a profile where they could create, add new tasks,
edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.

## Goals of this project:
> * Apply current knowledge in python in creating applications that have CRUD like behavior.
> * Apply SQL knowledge in accessing data from databases
> * Improve knowledge in version control using Git/Github

## Project Features:

> * Create a user account - The user can create their own profile by entering their desired username and password on the registration menu.
> * Multiple user accounts - Multiple accounts can be used in this application as the tasks created will be saved separately for each different user.
> * Users can create, modify, and delete tasks currently stored in their accounts.
> * Credentials stored in the database are encrypted, the passwords stored are enrcypted using the bcrypt module, while the tasks for each user are encypted using Fernet module.


## Todo list:
> * Refactor the code in the main() function to improve the efficiency of the app.
> * Add a "reset-your-password" functionality where the user could reset their own password in case they forgot their own password.
> * Add a GUI for this application either by using modules like tkinter, pygame, pysimplegui etc.
